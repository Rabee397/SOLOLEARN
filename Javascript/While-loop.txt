#the loop repeats through a block of code , but only as long as a specified condition is true.

syntax:
while(condition){
  code block
}

*endless loops aren't good.and one way of this hapening is if we forget to increase the variable used in condition.

question:
how many times will the loop run,if we remove the counting variable increment statement?
infinite.
