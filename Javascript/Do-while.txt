*this loop executes the code block once, before checking if the condition is true , and then it will repeat the loop as 
long as the condition is true.

syntax:
do{
 code block
}
while(condition);

-note the semicolon at the end of the loop . this is important.

example:

var i = 20;
do{
  document.write(i + "<br />");
  i++;
}
while(i <= 25);

output of this code:
20
21
22
23
24
25

*the loop will always be executed at least once , even if the condition is false , because the code block is executed 
before the condition is tested.
