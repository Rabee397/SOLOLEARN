syntax :
for (statement 1 ; statement 2 ; statement 3 )
{
  code block to be executed
}

and here's what happens when it runs:
statement 1 : is executed before the loop starts
statement 2 : defines the condition for running the loop (the code block).
statement 3 : is executed each time after the loop (the code block) has been executed.

notice:
-if statement 2 returns false , the loop will start over again , if it returns false , the loop will end.
-statement 2 is also optional , but only if you put a break inside the loop , otherwise the loop will never end!.
-statement 3 is used to change the initial variable , it also optional
